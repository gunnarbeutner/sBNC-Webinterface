         shroudBNC Webinterface by Felix 'Kunsi' Kunsmann

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This Webinterface for shroudBNC 1.2 was written to have a small,
lightweight interface for my users.
If you want any more features, feel free to ask me at Forums.

I will try to get every feature you are requesting to work, if it's
not fully useless.

I will *not* implement *any* Admin functionality. I think there are
enough commands to do this via IRC.
